Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

The data is collected through the Temperature Humidity sensor and then through integration through visual studio code. The file is then converted into a webpage, accessible to those with the proper connection and IP address. 

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:6908.

## Setting Up Arduino and Visual Studio:

Connect the necessary sensors to your Arduino board and esp32. 
Upload the Arduino code (Arduino_code. in) to your Esp32 using the Arduino IDE.

In Visual Studio, change the SSID, password, IP address, and local host to fit your specifications. Make sure you have npm installed as well. Afterwards, do npm run dev, and the URL should come up, and you can access your webpage
